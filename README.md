before attempting to compile and run game make sure you have some type of IDE  and openJDK installed into your machine.

1. once the files are downloaded open them via terminal into VScodium
2. make sure you are in the parent folder holding the three game files
3. compile your code with  " javac SnakeGame.java GameFrame.java GamePanel.java" 
4. run the game with "java SnakeGame"  --retype this command to show a new game once the game is over.
